# TERMINAL SNAKE

I've always liked seeing how far I could push textbased games. Snake was always one I wanted to try.

# HOW TO RUN
1. git clone "https://github.com/AHL96/Terminal-Snake"
2. cd Terminal-Snake
3. dotnet run

# If you don't have dotnet core installed do the following
1. git clone "https://github.com/AHL96/Terminal-Snake"
2. cd Terminal-Snake/publish
3. ./Terminal\ Snake
